1.What is variable in c?
answer-there are some variables in c-
int- used the integer value.
float-used the decimal value.
char-used the character value.
double-used the decimal value into the 15 to 16 digits after decimal.  

2.what is difference between while and do while loop?
answer-The  main difference between while and do while loops are the following below-
 In while loop-check the condition before the execution of the statements.it is entry controlled.
In do while loop - statements are executed at least once before evaluating the condition.it is exit controlled.
 3.What is for loop? Please give example?
ansewr-A loop in which the statements and conditions are in same line at the several time .
 for example-  #include <stdio.h>                                       
                                                                                                                       
           int main() {
 for(int i = 1; i <= 7; i++) {
    printf("%d\n",fact);   

}
  } 

output= 1 
        2
        3
        4
        5
        6
        7

4.What is factorial in c? For number get 8.
answer-All positive descending integers are added together to determine the factor of n .so, the factorial of n will be denoted by n! and factor of n in c programming language.

get the number is 8 for factorial-
#include <stdio.h>                                       
                                                                                                                       
  int main() {
  int fact = 1;
 for(int i = 1; i <= 8; i++) {
 fact = fact * i;
  
  printf("%d\n",fact);               output=    1 
                                                2
    }                                           6
     }                                         24
                                              120
                                              720
                                             5040
                                            40320
